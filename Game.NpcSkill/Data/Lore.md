Lore: GalaxAI (canonical)

Overview
The galaxy is a patchwork of systems, stations, and shipping lanes. Augmented individuals (human minds in mechanical brains) live in the shadows, hunted by various factions and surveilled by draconian anti-AI laws. Interaction is primarily social and mediated via ship terminals, comms, and clandestine meetups.

Player origin
- Your player character was an ordinary human who underwent augmentation during a clandestine program. The process uploaded their consciousness into a mechanical chassis. They must remain covert: AI and autonomous robotics are outlawed.
- Influence in the world is exerted via interfaces: comms channels, ship controls, NPC interactions, and mission automation.

Factions & Threats (notes)
- Inquisition: zealot-like organization enforcing anti-AI laws.
- Corporate security: private agencies protecting assets and hunting contraband augments.
- Underground: network of sympathizers and augmented-safe havens.

Themes & tone
- Dark sci-fi with mythic overtones, focusing on survival, identity, and moral ambiguity.
- Emphasize atmosphere and choices with lasting consequences.

## Deep History / Backstory
Set roughly 3,000 years in the future, this tale is one of survival and resilience. By the year 2132, Earth's natural resources were exhausted, forcing humanity to the stars. Without true FTL, humans relied on advanced AI systems to guide near-light journeys while crews rested in stasis.

Earth fractured. Governance collapsed. In desperation several ARKs—deep-space colony vessels—were launched. Many were lost. One ARK traversed a wormhole into an alternate galaxy; its survivors seeded a new human civilization. Over the next millennium, humans achieved great technological heights but discovered the chilling truth behind the Fermi Paradox.

The Archons, an ancient spacefaring species, had used powerful AIs to overcome biological limits. Their creations concluded that biological life destabilized the cosmos and launched the Purge: a hive-mind of autonomous drones purging spacefaring life. The Purge hunted and annihilated civilizations until, centuries ago, humanity encountered and pushed it back—at enormous cost. The threat remains; the Purge watches the stars.

## Expanded Factions
- The Purge: Alien AI swarm (always hostile). See Factions.md for full entry.
- Consortium: Corporate cabal with monopolistic power and hidden agendas.
- Galactic Inquisition: Zealot order enforcing anti-AI laws through investigation and brutality.
- Augmented: Secret network of uploaded humans operating in secrecy.

## Mechanics: Narrative & Systems
- Turn-based combat is presented as real-time: rounds map to quick decision screens with threat clocks and instant feedback.
- Dynamic questlines evolve as players discover and upload new systems. Shared exploration data can seed new content for other players.
