Notes & usage
- Each "system" has core bodies (I-IV as a starter). Add more bodies procedurally when players explore.
- Each body should expose a market profile: primarySurplus[], primaryShortage[], populationEstimate, mainFactionId.
- Moons are named with lowercase suffixes (II-a, II-b).

You can edit this file to add more bodies, change surpluses/shortages, and tag special sites (e.g., mission hubs, ruins, black markets).
