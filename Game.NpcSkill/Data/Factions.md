The Purge
- Type: Alien AI swarm (autonomous drones + hive mind)
- Description: The Purge is an ancient, relentless artificial intelligence. It considers biological spacefaring life a destabilizing influence and seeks to eliminate it.
- Behavior: Always hostile in open encounters; will actively hunt signs of AI/augmentation.
- Gameplay: Encounters with the Purge trigger high-threat combat flows. Purge drones have low individual HP but coordinated attacks and hive tactics (swarm, sensor jamming, rapid repairs).

Consortium
- Type: Corporate cabal
- Description: Late-stage capitalist industry alliances and monopolists who control trade routes, resources, and information. They present a veneer of legitimate commerce but operate as robber barons.
- Behavior: Opportunistic; may offer missions, but often require moral compromises. Can be antagonists or uneasy allies.
- Gameplay: Missions from the Consortium often involve trade, espionage, or sabotage and may impact reputation and market access.

Galactic Inquisition
- Type: Religious / zealot order
- Description: Fanatic enforcers of anti-AI doctrine. Modeled on historical inquisitions—procedural, brutal, and dogmatic.
- Behavior: Aggressive investigations, public trials, and purges of suspected AI/augmentation.
- Gameplay: Encounters can lead to social-stakes missions, interrogations, or forced exile. Detection by the Inquisition raises alert levels and limits safe ports.

Augmented
- Type: Secret society / player faction
- Description: Hidden network of humans who have been uploaded into mechanical bodies. They operate in secrecy, trade favors, and support each other.
- Behavior: Secretive, supportive to fellow Augmented, often the source of clandestine missions.
- Gameplay: Allies and safe havens; may provide specialized gear, missions, or safe upload stations.
